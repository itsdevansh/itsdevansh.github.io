                <p class="about-info">My journey with computer science didn’t have an exceptional or a very early start. On the
                    contrary, it started when I first arrived in college, with absolutely no clue whatsoever. I took this
                    decision purely based on the fact that I am a creative person who loves to create and build new
                    things. Prior to my computer science journey that outlet was poetry but I always knew that
                    computer science will surely broaden the horizon of what I could do with my creativity.
                    Initially, I had to climb a steep learning curve and in all honesty, it was really difficult, even
                    grasping the understanding of loops was a tedious task. But the more I threw myself into it more
                    enjoyable and pleasurable it got. The feeling of creating/ developing projects and products on
                    my own started to fuel me and my creativity.</p>
